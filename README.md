These are done using GET, PUT, PATCH & DELETE request



A PATCH request is a HTTP request method used to update a resource on the server. It is used to make partial updates to an existing resource, as opposed to replacing the entire resource with a PUT request. The request contains a set of instructions for updating the resource, and the server applies those changes to the existing resource. This method is often used in web APIs to allow clients to make partial updates to resources, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted compared to a full update with PUT.

A DELETE request is a HTTP request method used to request the server to delete a specific resource. It is used to remove a resource from the server, whether it be a file, database record, or other type of resource. When a client sends a DELETE request to a server, it is indicating that it no longer needs the specified resource and wants it to be removed. The server then processes the request and removes the resource, providing a response to the client indicating the status of the operation. This method is typically used in RESTful APIs to allow clients to remove resources, and is a fundamental component of many web services.
